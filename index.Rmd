## Project thoughts

What are the political leanings of owners of teams in the National Football League? In this study, I plan on examining to what extent the wealthy owners of NFL teams are involved in the political sphere -- more specifically, whether they lean more Democrat or Republican and how this leaning is manifested with their political donations. I hypothesize that these sports team owners largely lean Republican. Sports team owners are typically older men with large amounts of wealth -- a demographic that particularly votes Republican at much higher rates compared to other demographics. People of this socioeconomic status largely tend towards conservatism thanks to Republican policies that favor those of higher socioeconomic status -- for example, tax breaks for the wealthy. The "pro-business" stance that the Republican party has long stood by has garnered it the support of many wealthy figures; as such, I hypothesize that the case is much the same with wealthy NFL team owners.
